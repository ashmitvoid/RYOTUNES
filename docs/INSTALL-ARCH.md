# Install on Arch / CachyOS / Ryoku

Ryotunes is primarily distributed as a precompiled x86_64 pacman package. Normal users should install that package rather than compiling the Tauri application locally.

## Precompiled package

After downloading the package from the matching GitHub release:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./ryotunes-v2.4-2.4.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

The Ryoku distribution bundle also carries the managed migration/rollback helper used when replacing the stock Ryoku entry point. Use that bundle on systems where Ryotunes is already provided by `ryoku-desktop`.

## AUR binary package

The intended AUR package is `ryotunes-bin`. It downloads the precompiled release payload rather than compiling Rust/Tauri locally.

```bash
paru -S ryotunes-bin
```

This command will become usable after the AUR package is published.

## Build from source

Developers can build the repository directly. On Arch-based systems you need the normal Rust/Tauri frontend toolchain plus the runtime dependencies listed in `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD`.

```bash
cd ui
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
pnpm build

cd ..
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo tauri build --no-bundle
```

For a pacman package from the local checkout:

```bash
cd packaging/arch
makepkg -si
```

Before publishing a build, follow `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` rather than treating a successful local compile as a release gate.

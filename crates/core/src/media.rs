//! OS media integration (MPRIS / SMTC / NowPlaying) via `souvlaki`. fail-soft policy, D11.
//!
//! `souvlaki`'s `MediaControls` isn't `Send`, and on Windows/macOS its events arrive on the
//! platform's own loop — so we give it a dedicated owner thread. The app talks to that thread over
//! a channel ([`MediaHandle`]); OS control presses route back out over an mpsc channel of
//! [`MediaControlEvent`]s that the host drains into `AppState`. The two share the same commands the
//! UI uses, so they never drift.
